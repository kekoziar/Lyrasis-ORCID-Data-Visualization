# Set up orcid / crossref in R environment ------------------------------------------------------------

# if you've already done these steps and set up your bearer token in RStudio
# you can skip to the next section: "set some variablees and build the query"

# 1. If you haven’t done so already, create an ORCID account at https://orcid.org/signin. 
# 2. In the upper right corner, click your name, then in the drop-down menu, click Developer Tools. Note: In order to access Developer Tools, you must verify your email address. 
# 3. If you have not already verified your email address, you will be prompted to do so at this point.
# 4. Click the “Register for the free ORCID public API” button
# 5. Review and agree to the terms of service when prompted.
# 6. Add your name in the Name field, https://www.orcid.org in the Your Website URL field, “Getting public API key” in Description field, and https://www.orcid.org in the redirect URI field. Click the diskette button to save.
# 7. A gray box will appear including your Client ID and Client Secret. In the below code chunk, copy and paste the client ID and the client secret respectively. 
# 8. Make sure to leave the quotation marks (e.g. orcid_client_id <- "APP-FDFJKDSLF320SDFF" and orcid_client_secret <- "c8e987sa-0b9c-82ed-91as-1112b24234e"). 

# moved secret to secret # copy/paste your client ID from https://orcid.org/developer-tools
# orcid_client_id <- "PASTE MY CLIENT ID HERE"

# copy/paste your client secret from https://orcid.org/developer-tools
# orcid_client_secret <- "PASTE MY CLIENT SECRET HERE"

# This gets a /read-public scope access token
orcid_request <- POST(url  = "https://orcid.org/oauth/token",

                      encode = "form")

# parse the API request with content
orcid_response <- content(orcid_request)

# run the following code
print(orcid_response$access_token)

#You will see a string of text print out in your R console.
# Copy that string to the clipboard 
# so we can  save the token to our R environment
# Run this code:
usethis::edit_r_environ()

# A new window will open in RStudio.
# In this separate R environment page, type the following (except the pound sign):
# ORCID_TOKEN="my-token"
# replace 'my-token' with the access_token you just copied. 
# Then press enter to create a new line.
# while we are here, we'll add in our rcrossref credentials
# type crossref_email="name@example.com", using your own email address.
# press enter to create a new line, and leave it blank. 
# Press Ctrl + S (Mac: Cmd + S) to save this information to your R environment and close the window. 
# You won't see anything happen here because it is just saving the page.

# Click Session > Restart R. Your token should now be saved to your R environment. 

# You will now need to rerun all the packages ("library()" commands) above, then return to this line.

#You can confirm this worked by calling orcid_auth(), and it will print the token

##### Code improvement

# in order to keep refining the data. so it would be good to take this code out and
# put it in a function that we could just call here instead of re-running similar lines of code
##### Code improvement
